            <h3>Reflective Writing 1</h3>
            <p>This week’s reading, from Chapter 2, focused on planning before publishing anything, irrespective of the media used. In this case, it is for a website, thus Planning should include questions like why, who and “what’s the conversation”.</p>
<p>Asking why forces the author to focus very specifically on what the goal is. i.e., the purpose. Is it to make money, gain clicks, disseminate information, for example? Once a specific goal or goals is identified that then helps to shift to the type of successful conversation needed to be had with the website’s prospective users. To do so requires the author to understand they type of visitors to the website.</p>
<p>To understand the website’s visitors requires information gathering. This can be achieved by reading emails submitted through “contact us”, reading feedback submitted regarding the website, reviews/recommendations/blogsites and customer service staff and marketing staff. There is also web analytics that can provide a wealth of information as to duration, websites viewed, search queries submitted and more. Analyzing all this information will help create a portfolio of the type of visitors to the website. The analysis should provide broad categories into which this information is placed. I.e., key phrases or quotes, experience, emotions, values, technology.</p>
<p>Armed with this information, this data can be used to create personas. A persona in this context would be a composite of characteristics of real visitors of the website, which would constitute a group. By doing the this the data comes to “life” and provides a reference point in group discussions for site improvements and further analysis. A Website could have multiple personas to represent the various visitors that come to the website. This helps make planning very thorough and effective and provides the author with detailed information and how to communicate on the website. Scenarios can further describe the personas created. Scenarios can be as short as two sentences or a much longer story describing the persona. Website content must be related to at least one scenario, as the purpose is to keep the visitor interested in the content provided. The benefit of scenarios is, it shows the focus of what is important to visitors, how goal-oriented visitors are and thus being able to write with the site’s visitors in mind as well as presenting the content as a conversation.</p>
<p>A content strategy is also very important as the message needs to be aligned with the business goal. Messaging must be consistent and credible. Content must be accurate and current, and presented in such a way that it looks organized and not cluttered. A content strategy is primarily about governance, meaning it is planned, coordinated, reviewed regularly, current and maintained by an authorized individual or team.</p>
<p>My takeaway from having read Chapter Two and Interlude 1, is that planning is crucial when it comes to writing or publishing information on a website. Planning is a detailed process and if done the right way, will provide a lot of insight into the type of visitors that the website will attract and whether they will leave happy and come back or move on to the next website. Content strategy forms part of the planning process and is also very important. The concept of personas and scenarios was very interesting as it helps to understand the data being worked with and how to make use of it effectively, for making the message attractive or the website attractive.</p>
