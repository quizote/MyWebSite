            <h5>Reflective Writing 2</h5>
            <p>Pathway pages or landing pages are pages that help website visitors find information effectively and efficiently. Their primary function is helping visitors scan, select and move on. There are six categories that this chapter highlights on pathway pages.</p>
  <p>First, “site visitors hunt first”. This is described as a visitor ignoring all other information and going directly for a “good” link that stands out.</p>
  <p>Seccondly, “People don’t want to read”. Website visitors are looking for information and do not want to read long and dense paragraphs. Description of links need to be short to help visitors move quickly to where they want to go.</p>
  <p>Thirdly, “A pathway page is like a table of contents”. The description is not very different from the second point above. Visitors need a quick overview of what the webpage offers and help them pick where they want to go next.</p>
  <p>Fourthly, “Sometimes short descriptions help”. Where links are not that obvious, a brief description may help the website visitor by providing enough information, so they can click on the next link and help them navigate quickly. In addition, jargon needs to be tailored specifically. The use of personas is recommended to find the right jargons. Pictures also can be easily identified and can convey information but can still get frustrating for a visitor. Short descriptive words can help a website visitor along. As an example, on a shopping website, several pictures of dresses show the product available, but a brief description of the picture and a price is very helpful in letting the visitor make a decision. Sometimes, pictures look similar and it is the descriptive words that separates them in the mind of the visitor. A good example here is a product line of mobile phones, all with similar design but vastly different features.</p>
  <p>Fifthly, “Three clicks is a myth”. This simply means that, in practice, building a website that allow navigation with just a few clicks is highly impracticable. Rather the focus should be on stacking information or links so they make sense. The visitor should be able to move forward efficiently and thus quickly without getting lost and having to use the “back” button to go to a previous step for more information. The back button introduces inefficiency and requires a rethink on how the website is designed because the information flow needs to be “smooth”.</p>
  <p>Lastly, “Many people choose the first option”. Decisions are bases on what seems “good enough” without exploring all the option. Visitors have the tendency of clicking on the first link that looks useful rather than taking time to read and review all available links. This requires analyzing the information being provided from the website creators standpoint and placing more important links on top. Order becomes very important.</p>
  <p>What this chapter has taught me is that pathway pages are an important tool when designing a website. They help visitors to save time by providing efficiency in accessing information and also put the onus on the creators to arrange information (links) in order of priority for visitors to find them.</p>
