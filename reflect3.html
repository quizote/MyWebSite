      <h3><strong>Reflective Writing</strong></h3>
      </p>

            <h5>Reflective Writing 3</h5>
            <p>For this weekly post I listened to the 10-minute Tech Podcast interview of Andrew Etter. Andrew made some very insightful comments and observations for anyone writing in the software industry. Here are my takeaways from this interview.</p>
<p>Etter placed a lot of emphasis on tools such as analytics to gather quantitative data on readers habits. He said it was important to get this data as that gives the writer a good idea of what people are reading and also how the document “flows” in terms of information.</p>
<p>Next, he talked about search engine optimization. It is important search is optimized so the right pages get pulled up when a search query is entered. This is tied back to using analytics to identify what is happening in the document to ensure the right results get pulled up.</p>
<p>Etter says “Don’t write”. What he means here is that don’t just listen to other but understand the product that you are writing about. Learn the concepts, test the product, understand how it works and become subject matter competent. This will make the software writer write much better documentation. If you are not subject matter competent and relaying information from others, then important details about the product are going to get missed.</p>
<p>Getting to know the audience as a writer is also important. Developers themselves are not eager to listen to their audience but for a writer it is critical. Study metrics, interview actual customers, talk to product managers, and figure out what they want to do and how to actually do it.</p>
<p>Etter talks about the concept of MVP in the software industry. MVP stands for minimal viable product. The idea behind the concept being that a product is created with minimal features but providing sufficient customer value. Early adopters then use the product, create feedback and the feedback can be used to enhance the product further. This concept can be applied to writing where the writer puts together an outline that includes important things required for the document. Let coworkers review them, gather feedback, improve it, and then release them to the world as well.</p>
<p>Lastly, Etter talks about style guides and templates. Older writers tend to be very conscious of adhering to a certain style to create consistency in the documents, at the expense of actual useful information. Etter thinks it is better to allow for flexibility in writing to accommodate more ideas, than focusing on style and presentation, which can make a document wordier than it necessarily should be.</p>
<p>In conclusion, technical writing is a continuous process. There is no need to try and write the perfect document the first time and move on to the next. Emphasis should be on writing the content, understanding the product, gathering feedback from early users as quickly as possible. Then also pushing updates to the document out as quickly as possible. In effect, the document is a living document and will be updated regularly to continue improving the content and make it better.</p>
