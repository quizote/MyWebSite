      <h3><strong>Reflective Writing</strong></h3>

            <h5>Reflective Writing 4</h5>
          <p>This week’s writing looks at Chapter four of the textbook. This chapter looks at focusing the message for the user. The chapter starts by outlining seven guidelines to keep the message focused.</p>
            <p>The first guideline states “to give people only what they need”. This first guideline includes a 10-step process to prune the message to make it as focused as possible. Visitors to a website come looking for a specific message or information. That information needs to be readily available. Content that is important to the website creator/publisher may not necessarily be as important to the website visitor. Any extraneous information needs to be dropped entirely or moved to the bottom of the page, so it does not distract the visitor.</p>
            <p>The second guideline continues with further reducing the message or removing extra information. In so doing there also needs to be some analysis of the content creator’s goals, the personas involved, the personas goals and the conversations the personas initiate. Such an analysis can significantly help in reducing the number of words required to present the information. In one example given, after going through these steps, 40% fewer words were required on that website.</p>
            <p>Guideline three suggests thinking of information in three pieces. A bite, a snack or a meal? Some people just need a soundbite or bullet point. Others need additional information to flesh out the bullet point. And others still need the entire picture i.e., all the information available. Guideline three brings us back to how to layer information to keep the web visitor interested. Level one being the “bite”, then providing links to additional information as required.</p>
            <p>Guideline four highlights the importance getting the key message out first. The key message/information needs to be put first, for example, in a headline (which in this case is the “bite”), and then elaborated further (which would constitute the snack). This maybe enough for many visitors to stay on the site to explore it further. A good bite and a snack need to capture the site visitors attention to make them less likely to leave the site. It is further suggested that content writers use an “inverted pyramid style” rather than a “narrative style”. In an inverted pyramid, the main point comes first which is read by most people. This gets followed by supporting information, read by less people. The third level in the pyramid provides additional information but gets read by even less people. Writing in inverted pyramid style requires a major shift in thinking but is an important style to master for writing on the web and being successful.</p>
            <p>The fifth guideline looks at layering of information. Layering done well avoids site visitors from getting overwhelmed with information. This also serves the purpose of breaking down the information into different levels for visitors who need it. The chapter continues by giving examples of layering on a website by using a “rollover” feature where information gets displayed when the mouse cursor hovers above highlighted text.</p>
            <p>The next guideline talks about “dense information”. It is important to break up walls of words, so it does not appear as dense i.e. a lot of information to be read all at once. It is important to use headlines, keep sentences short and use paragraphs to break up text for easy reading and digesting of information.</p>
            <p>The last guideline refers to sharing information with social media. Social media requirements need information to be kept short (think Twitters’ 140-character limitation), it doesn’t matter which media is being used, the requirements remain the same. Messages need to be kept short for visitors to engage with the information presented i.e., think “bite, snack, meal”.</p>
