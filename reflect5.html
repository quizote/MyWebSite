            <p><h4>Reflective Writing 5</h4></p>
          <p>ELECTRONIC PRODUCT MANUAL FOR A <strong>YAMAHA AV RECEIVER</strong> MODEL RX-V677.
            <h4>Review of Content page</h4>
            <p>The manual starts off with a Content page which is well laid out. The content page has five underlined sub-headings with pages listed for each topic. Each topic also is hyperlinked, making navigation very quick. i.e., a mouse-click takes the reader straight to the relevant content. Hyperlinked text can be identified by hovering the mouse over the text, the mouse cursor then changes from an arrow to a pointy hand.</p>
            <h4>Graphical presentations</h4>
            <p>After the content page, the reader is presented with the accessories page. This page shows all the accessories that should have come with the product when it was shipped. i.e. remote control, antenna, cables, etc. This is followed by a picture of the product itself with detailed labels for the individual functions for both the front panel and the back panel. There are a lot of functions, but the image is not cluttered as numbers were used to label each feature. The numbers are then presented in a table format with detailed descriptions for the functions. The product has an LCD display which is also presented as a separate image. The LCD image is described into detail with what each display means to the user. There is a separate page for the Remote-Control image as well, with details of each button and the functions it performs.</p>
            <h4>Setup Instructions</h4>
            <p>Setup instructions for the product are divided into 11 separate categories. This makes it very easy to look up an item if the setup did not go as planned, without having to go through unnecessary information to find that specific item. The text is also bolded slightly and hyperlinked for easy navigation. Where required additional images are provided for clarity. An example is the speaker setup, which includes multiple images to help the reader understand how or what type of setup to be used for effective surround sound.</p>
            <h4>Trouble shooting</h4>
            <p>There is a detailed trouble shooting section, which is well laid out. It is separated into Audio, Video, USB/Networking and FM/Radio. The categories are divided into problem statement, possible causes and possible solutions. This makes it very easy to try and find the relevant problem and fixes for the problem.</p>
            <h4>Legal and appendix</h4>
            <p>Legal information is found at the back of the manual which is ideal, as that is information not directly required for the product to function properly. There is also an appendix towards the end for easy lookup of specific terms.</p>
            <h4>Improvements</h4>
            <p>This manual is quite long with a total of 183 pages. This manual would have benefited from a quick guide for a basic setup for the sound. This should have been included at the beginning so the user can get up and running very quickly and enjoy music right away.</p>
