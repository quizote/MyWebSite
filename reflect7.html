    <h5>Reflective Writing 7</h5>
    <p>For this reflective writing assignment, I am reviewing Chapter Eleven of the textbook. This chapter is about the use of lists and tables when writing. These are summarized into six guidelines for effective use of lists and tables.</p>
    <p>The first guideline states “Use bulleted lists for items or options”. Essentially, when there are multiple items being mentioned it is best to put them in a bulleted list. This makes find specific items easy and helps readers check items off
      manually without too much mental effort.</p>
    <p>The next guideline is “Match bullets to your site’s personality”. This simply implies to get creative if there is a chance to do so. Regular bullets (black round dots) are generally accepted. However, if the content being created is for
      example, more artistic, it is ok to also get more creative with different styles of bullets to match the artistic design. Instead of just round dots, bullets could be actual objects like a car or an animal.</p>
    <p>“Use numbered lists for instructions” is the third guideline. Anytime instructions are given like how to arrange a party or steps to pay a bill, it is a great idea to use numbered lists. This has the advantage of letting the reader immediately
      see how many steps are required, getting the correct order of steps, being able to identify a single step and being able to come back to it, if necessary. As a content creator, a numbered list helps to ensure no step is forgotten, steps are in
      the correct order, and being able to verify that the steps actually work as expected, i.e. testing the steps one-by-one. It is also recommended to use “if… else” statements where appropriate if steps don’t follow each other exactly and keep
      paragraphs relatively short. There is nothing wrong also with including a picture to explain a step to the reader.</p>
    <p>The fourth guideline states “Keep most lists short”. Two recommendations are made here, the first is to make a list no more than <strong>five to ten</strong> items long if the material is very unfamiliar. The second recommendation says it is
      ok to use long lists if the material presented is familiar. An example of a familiar list is the states that make up the USA. Since most people would know there are fifty states, it is ok to have a list that is fifty items long.</p>
    <p>The fifth guideline is “Try to start list items the same way”. Most people are pattern-oriented and maintaining the same pattern helps readers to read lists faster and more easily.</p>
    <p>The final guideline is “Format lists well”. Formatting a list is all about how the information in the list is presented. Four keys are mentioned to help with formatting, namely, <strong>reducing space between the introduction and list, put
        space between long list items, wrap lines under each other</strong> and <strong>put what happens on a line by itself.</strong> Formatting also presents a choice of whether to use a table or to use a list. The distinction here is that a table
      should be used for “if..then” situations. “if” in this instance maybe the first column, and “then” the subsequent columns. A table should be used in instances where one list item can reference multiple lists. A list should be used if only one
      item is being referenced. There are a further six guidelines mentioned for how to make a useful table.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, using lists keeps information well organized, and helps readers to easily navigate the page. This chapter was very informative and made me appreciate the use of lists in my writing.</p>
